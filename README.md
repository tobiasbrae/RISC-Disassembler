#RISC-Disassembler
Small, fast coded project in a challenge to disassemble the .hex-file of an Atmel AVR (written in C, 2017-04).
As it was a time-challenge, the code is not commented at all. Basically it reads the hex-file and the instruction
set in a special prepared format and then writes the assembler instructions into another file.
